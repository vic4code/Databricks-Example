# MAGIC ## Explore Data with Summary Stats
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While using notebooks, you have various options to view summary statistics for dataset. Some of these options are:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * using spark DataFrame's built-in method (e.g. `summary()`)
# MAGIC * using databricks' utility methods (e.g. `dbutils.data.summarize()`)
# MAGIC * using databricks' built-in data profiler/visualizations
# MAGIC * using external libraries such as `matplotlib`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section we will go over the Spark's and Databricks' built-in features for summarizing data. In the next section, we will explore the visualization options.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The first and simplest way is using Spark's `summary` function.

# COMMAND ----------

# Display summary statistics with spark
display(telco_df.summary())

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Another way of displaying summary statistics is to use Databricks' `summarize` function. The **`summarize`** function automatically generates a comprehensive report for the dataframe. This report encompasses crucial statistics, data types, and the presence of missing values, providing a holistic view of the dataset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Within this generated summary, the interactive features allow us to sort the information by various criteria:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Feature Order
# MAGIC * Non-Uniformity
# MAGIC * Alphabetical
# MAGIC * Amount Missing/Zero
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Furthermore, leveraging the datatype information, we can selectively filter out specific datatypes for in-depth analysis. This functionality enables us to create charts tailored to our analytical preferences, facilitating a deeper understanding of the dataframe and extracting valuable insights.

# COMMAND ----------

dbutils.data.summarize(telco_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The **`Display`** function not only facilitates the viewing of detailed dataframes but also serves as a powerful tool for visualizing our dataset according to individual preferences. Whether opting for a Pie Chart or a Bar Chart, this functionality allows for a more insightful exploration, uncovering dependencies and patterns within the dataframe features.

# MAGIC ### Exploring Data with Custom Aggregation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Taking a closer look at `PaymentMethod`, let's review the distribution of the data for this column by calculating aggregated counts per payment type.  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, we utilize the **`groupBy`** and **`count`** functions to analyze the distribution of payment methods in the Telco Churn dataset. The `orderBy` clause is applied to present the results in an organized manner, providing insights into the frequency of each payment method within the dataset.

# COMMAND ----------

display(telco_df.groupBy("PaymentMethod").count().orderBy("count", ascending=False))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Observation: Identifying Payment Method Distribution**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Through the groupBy command on the "`PaymentMethod`" column, we observe the distribution of payment methods within the Telco Churn dataset. The result reveals that **Electronic check** is the most frequently used method, while other methods such as Bank transfer and Credit card (automatic) also exhibit substantial usage. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Additionally, there are **704 instances with missing payment method** information.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### External Visualization Tools
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can use any external visualization library to create custom visualization In this demo, we will use popular python library `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for creating custom visualizations.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **First, we will convert the DataFrame to Pandas.**

# COMMAND ----------

# Convert to pandas dataframe 
telco_pdf = telco_df.toPandas()

# COMMAND ----------

display(telco_pdf)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 1. Correlation Heatmap
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will import the **`seaborn`** library, to create a correlation heatmap to visually represent the correlation matrix among numerical features. This provides insights into the strength and direction of relationships between variables.

# COMMAND ----------

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Select columns that are the numerical columns
selected_columns = ['tenure', 'TotalCharges', 'MonthlyCharges']

# Select the specified columns from the DataFrame
telco_corr = telco_pdf[selected_columns].corr()

# Create a heatmap using seaborn
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(telco_corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=.5)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap for Telco Dataset')
plt.show()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### 2. Pairplot for Numerical Variables:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Generate a pairplot to visualize relationships between **numerical variables**. This provides a quick overview of how features interact and whether certain patterns emerge based on the `'Churn'` status.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# Select columns that are the numerical columns
selected_columns = ['tenure', 'TotalCharges', 'MonthlyCharges']

# Select the specified columns from the DataFrame
telco_ppdf = telco_pdf[selected_columns + ['Churn']]

# Pairplot for a quick overview of relationships between numerical variables
sns.pairplot(telco_ppdf, hue='Churn', diag_kind='kde')
plt.suptitle('Pairplot for Telco Dataset', y=1.02)
plt.show()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 3. Boxplot for Monthly Charges by Churn:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Create a boxplot to visually compare the distribution of monthly charges between customers who churned and those who didn't.

# COMMAND ----------

# Boxplot for visualizing the distribution of Monthly Charges by Churn
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Churn', y='MonthlyCharges', data=telco_pdf)
plt.title('Monthly Charges Distribution by Churn Status')
plt.show()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Write dataframe to delta (bronze) table

# COMMAND ----------

# Specify the desired name for the table
table_name_bronze = "telco_missing_bronze"
telco_df.write.saveAsTable(table_name_bronze) # will be stored under default catalog and schema

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Time-Travel with Delta
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now, let's explore the fascinating concept of time-travel with Delta. Here, we're delving into versioning, allowing us to read a specific or previous version of our dataset. It's a powerful feature, but in the realm of machine learning, caution is advised. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **💡 Note:** While versioning can be crucial for reproducibility, **it may pose challenges for ML, where experiments often span longer timeframes than typical data retention periods**. The delicate balance between versioning and ML practices is a topic to tread carefully, keeping in mind potential drawbacks when utilizing previous dataset versions.

# COMMAND ----------

# Drop columns and overwrite table
to_drop_wrong = ["gender", "SeniorCitizen"]
telco_dropped_df = telco_df.drop(*to_drop_wrong)

telco_dropped_df.write.mode("overwrite").option("overwriteSchema", True).saveAsTable(table_name_bronze)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Reverting Changes by Version
# MAGIC
# MAGIC What to do, if we drop a column by mistake?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC With Delta's powerful time-travel feature, we can seamlessly revert to a previous version of our dataset. Let's initiate this process by using the **'`DESCRIBE HISTORY`'** SQL command. This command provides us with a comprehensive history of changes, allowing us to pinpoint the version where '`SeniorCitizen`' was still part of our dataset. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's explore and revert our unintentional omission.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC DESCRIBE HISTORY telco_missing_bronze

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Examine the schema to validate whether columns were dropped, specifically verifying if the 'gender' & 'SeniorCitizen' columns have been removed.

# COMMAND ----------

spark.table(table_name_bronze).printSchema()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC DESCRIBE `telco_missing_bronze`;

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Reverting Changes by Version
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC As we can see in the **`operation`** column in version 1, the table was overwritten, leading to the unintentional removal of columns. To rectify this, we must now perform a time-travel operation, reverting to version 0, to retrieve the table with all the original columns intact.

# COMMAND ----------

telco_df_v0 = (
  spark.read
      .option("versionAsOf", 0)
      .table(table_name_bronze)
)

telco_df_v0.printSchema()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Reverting Changes by Timestamp
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can also query based upon **`timestamp`**.  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note that the ability to query an older snapshot of a table (time travel) is lost after running <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/delta-vacuum.html" target="_blank">a VACUUM command.</a>**

# COMMAND ----------

# Extract timestamp of first version (can also be set manually)
timestamp_v0 = spark.sql(f"DESCRIBE HISTORY telco_missing_bronze").orderBy("version").first().timestamp
print(timestamp_v0)

# COMMAND ----------

(spark
        .read
        .option("timestampAsOf", timestamp_v0)
        .table("telco_missing_bronze")
        .printSchema()
)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Based on original version we can specifically drop the the correct columns of disinterest and save the table again

# COMMAND ----------

to_drop = ['']
telco_dropped_df = telco_df_v0.drop(*to_drop)

telco_dropped_df.write.mode("overwrite").option("overwriteSchema", True).saveAsTable(table_name_bronze)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Version 2 is our latest and most accurate table version.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC DESCRIBE HISTORY `telco_missing_bronze`;

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This demo successfully navigated the essential aspects of data management and exploration using Delta tables and Pandas. We seamlessly read and wrote data, performed time-travel operations for versioning, and computed insightful statistics for machine learning. The integrated visualizations, including correlation matrices and pair plots, provided a deeper understanding of the Telco dataset. By showcasing the power of Delta and Pandas, we've equipped ourselves with valuable tools to efficiently manage, analyze, and derive meaningful insights from our data.
