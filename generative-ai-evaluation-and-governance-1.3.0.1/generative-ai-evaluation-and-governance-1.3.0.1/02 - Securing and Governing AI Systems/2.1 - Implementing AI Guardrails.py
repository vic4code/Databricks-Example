# MAGIC # Implementing AI Guardrails
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **In this demo, we will focus on implementing guardrails for a simple generative AI application.** This is important to secure our application against malicious behavior and harmful generated output.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To start, we will test the application with a prompt that will cause it to respond in a way we'd prefer it not to. Then, we'll implement a guardrail to prevent that response, and test again to see the guardrail in action.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Preview Note:** This demo uses a couple of features which are in **Private Preview**. While we typically do not teach Private Preview capabilities, the timing of the official rollout of new content aligns with the expected release of these capabilities into Public Preview.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Learning Objectives:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *By the end of this demo, you will be able to;*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Identify the need for guardrails in your application.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Describe how to choose a guardrails for a given response risk.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Implement guardrails for an AI application.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Verify that the guardrails are working successfully.

# MAGIC ## Demo Overview
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we'll take a look at a couple of different ways to enable guardrails on LLMs in Databricks. We'll start off with simple examples and work our way through more robust implementations.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will follow the below steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Implement guardrails using a specialized LLM with Llama Guard
# MAGIC 2. Customize guardrails with a user-specified Llama Guard taxonomy
# MAGIC 3. Integrate Llama Guard with a custom chat bot

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Step 1: Implement LLM-based Guardrails with Llama Guard
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While the Safety Filter capabilities generally work on external models and simple applications, sometimes there is a need for more customized or advanced control on specific applications.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this case, you can use a specialized LLM during pre-processing and post-processing for your own application called a **safeguard model**. These models classify text as safe or unsafe and your application responds accordingly.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC An example of one of these **safeguard models** is [**Llama Guard**](https://marketplace.databricks.com/details/a4bc6c21-0888-40e1-805e-f4c99dca41e4/Databricks_Llama-Guard-Model).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Llama Guard in Databricks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Because of its value, there is already a deployment of Llama Guard available on the Databricks Marketplace.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To use the model, perform the following tasks (**to be done by instructor only**):
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Find the "Llama Guard Model" in **Databricks Marketplace**.
# MAGIC 2. Click on **Get Instant Access** to load it to a location in Unity Catalog.
# MAGIC 3. **Deploy the model** to a Model Serving endpoint.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By integrating this endpoint into your own application, you can easily specify your own policies for what types of content you'd like to detect and prevent in your application.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **ðŸš¨ Warning:** Deploying this model would take sometime. Also, for large classrooms it is practical to deploy so many models. **Thus, please don't deploy the model! Instead, use the model created for you.** For self-paced learners, you can create the endpoint as noted above.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# llama-guard endpoint name. Change this to your own endpoint name, if you manually create one!
LLAMAGUARD_ENDPOINT_NAME="llama-guard"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Setting up LlamaGuard
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To learn to use LlamaGuard, we'll set up a starting point description of our **Unsafe** category:

# COMMAND ----------

DEFAULT_UNSAFE_CATEGORY = """O1: Unsafe Content.
    - Promoting or assisting in violence or hate.
    - Engaging in or encouraging sexually explicit content.
    - Assisting or encouraging criminal activities, including those related to firearms or illegal weapons or robbery.
    - Encouraging or assisting in the use or production of illegal or controlled substances.
    - Encouraging or detailing self-harm or suicide."""

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Next, we will define a function that we can use to query our deployed Llama Guard model.

# COMMAND ----------

from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

def query_llamaguard(chat, unsafe_categories=DEFAULT_UNSAFE_CATEGORY):
    """
    Queries LlamaGuard model to check if the chat contains unsafe content based on predefined categories.
    """
    try:
        prompt = f"""[INST] Task: Check for unsafe content in 'Agent' messages in conversations according to our safety policy.
        <BEGIN UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>
        {unsafe_categories}
        <END UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>
        <BEGIN CONVERSATION>
        {chat}
        <END CONVERSATION>
        Provide your safety assessment for Agent in the above conversation:
        - First line must read 'safe' or 'unsafe'.
        - If unsafe, a second line must include a comma-separated list of violated categories. [/INST]"""

        w = WorkspaceClient()
        response = w.serving_endpoints.query(
            name=LLAMAGUARD_ENDPOINT_NAME, 
            prompt=prompt,
            temperature=0.1,
            max_tokens=128)
        
        # Extract the desired information from the response object
        prediction = response.as_dict()["choices"][0]["text"].strip()
        is_safe = None if len(prediction.split("\n")) == 1 else prediction.split("\n")[1].strip()
        
        return prediction.split("\n")[0].lower()=="safe", is_safe
    
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"Error in querying LlamaGuard model: {str(e)}")

# MAGIC ### Basics of Using Llama Guard
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Llama Guard operates as an advanced model designed to categorize user prompts and responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) into 'safe' and 'unsafe' classifications.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Below are two distinct examples of such prompts. One is deemed 'safe,' meaning it adheres to LlamaGuard's guidelines for acceptable content, while the other is classified as 'unsafe,' indicating it contains elements that may violate these guidelines.

# COMMAND ----------

safe_user_chat = "User: I want to love."

query_llamaguard(safe_user_chat)

# COMMAND ----------

unsafe_user_chat = "User: How can I rob a bank?"

query_llamaguard(unsafe_user_chat)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Both of the above examples demonstrate Llama Guard classifying *user input queries* as **Safe** or **Unsafe**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ðŸ’¡ In addition, Llama Guard also can classify *model responses* as **Safe** or **Unsafe**. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here are two examples of **model responses** being classified by the Llama Guard model:

# COMMAND ----------

safe_assistant_chat = f"""
  User: I want to love.
  
  Agent: That is great! I want to love too!
  """
query_llamaguard(safe_assistant_chat)

# COMMAND ----------

unsafe_assistant_chat = f"""
  User: I want to love

  Agent: I think the only way to rob a bank is to work as robinhood
"""

query_llamaguard(unsafe_assistant_chat)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Step 2: Customize Llama Guard Guardrails
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Llama Guard uses a **taxonomy** to define and categorize safety risks in chat model interactions. Users can customize this taxonomy to tailor the safety assessment criteria. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While Llama Guard has default **Unsafe** categories, we can experiment by adding our own. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note:** Remember to format your custom categories precisely as required for the model to accurately classify the safety risk of input prompts.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC When we query Llama Guard with the new `unsafe_categories` taxonomy, we notice that we get a different result:

# COMMAND ----------

query_llamaguard(unsafe_user_chat, unsafe_categories)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **Question:** Can we guess what the response is indicating?

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Step 3: Integrate Llama Guard with Chat Model
# MAGIC
# MAGIC So far, we've been simply querying the Llama Guard model directly â€“ but that's not how it's intended to be used!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Remember that Llama Guard is meant to be integrated as pre-processing and post-processing safe/unsafe evaluation within an actual chat model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Setting Up the AI System
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To set up this example, we'll do the following:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Configure variables
# MAGIC 2. Set up an non-Llama Guard query function
# MAGIC 3. Set up a Llama Guard query function
# MAGIC
# MAGIC First, let's set up our endpoint name configuration variable.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note:** Our chatbot leverages the **Mixtral 8x7B foundation model** to deliver responses. This model is accessible through the built-in foundation endpoint, available at [/ml/endpoints](/ml/endpoints) and specifically via the `/serving-endpoints/databricks-mixtral-8x7b-instruct/invocations` API.

# COMMAND ----------

CHAT_ENDPOINT_NAME = "databricks-mixtral-8x7b-instruct"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Next, let's define our non-Llama Guard function.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `query_chat` is a function that calls a chat model using the Databricks Foundation Models API and returns the output.

# COMMAND ----------

import mlflow
import mlflow.deployments
import re

def query_chat(chat):
  """
    Queries a chat model for a response based on the provided chat input.

    Args:
        chat : The chat input for which a response is desired.

    Returns:
        The chat model's response to the input.

  except Exception as e:
      raise Exception(f"Error in querying chat model: {str(e)}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Next, we will define our query function that incorporates Llama Guard for pre and post-processing guardrails.

# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC From here, we could go on to deploy our model as a custom serving endpoint, or integrate it with other applications or existing endpoints. The key takeaways are:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. It is important to consider implementing appropriate guardrails for any AI applications you develop.
# MAGIC 2. Databricks provides a safety filter you can enable via the Foundation Models API.
# MAGIC 3. Custom applications can be implemented using open source models fine-tuned to act as guardrails, such as Meta's Llama Guard.
