# MAGIC ## Requirements
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Please review the following requirements before starting the lesson:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * To run this notebook, you need to use one of the following Databricks runtime(s): **14.3.x-cpu-ml-scala2.12 14.3.x-scala2.12**

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Classroom Setup
# MAGIC Before starting the lab, execute the provided classroom setup script to install the required libraries and configure necessary variables.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %pip install --upgrade databricks-sdk mlflow==2.14.3
# MAGIC dbutils.library.restartPython()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup-02

# MAGIC ##Task 1: Implement LLM-based Guardrails with `Llama Guard`
# MAGIC First, To set up the safety measures of your application, you will integrate Llama Guard, a specialized model available on the Databricks Marketplace. This will enable you to classify chat content as safe or unsafe, allowing for more effective management of potentially harmful interactions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Llama Guard in Databricks**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To streamline the integration process and leverage the benefits of Llama Guard, a deployment of this model is readily available on the Databricks Marketplace.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions (To be performed by the instructor only):**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Find the "Lllama Guard Model" in **Databricks Marketplace**.
# MAGIC 2. Click on **Get Instant Access** to load it to a location in Unity Catalog.
# MAGIC 3. **Deploy the model** to a Model Serving endpoint.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By integrating the Model Serving endpoint into your own application, you gain the flexibility to specify your own policies for detecting and preventing various types of content. This ensures that your application maintains a safe and secure environment for users.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **🚨 Warning:** Please avoid deploying the model yourself, as it may take time and might not be practical in a classroom setting. Instead, utilize the model that has been provided for this lab. For self-paced learners, you can follow the steps above to create the endpoint.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC 1. **Set Up Llama Guard Model and Configuration Variables**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     Set up a starting point description of your **Unsafe** category:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     * **To do:**
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC         You have been provided with 2 categories. Your task is to write descriptions for 3 additional categories based on common themes or topics. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC         **Hint:** You can use AI Playground to generate descriptions for these categories, ensuring they are relevant and distinct from the provided examples.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Integrate Llama Guard with the chat model to ensure safe interactions between users and the AI system. You'll define two functions: `query_chat` and `query_chat_safely`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC First, let's set up the endpoint name configuration variable.
