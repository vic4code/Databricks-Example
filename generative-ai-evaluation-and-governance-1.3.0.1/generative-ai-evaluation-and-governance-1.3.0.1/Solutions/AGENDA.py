# MAGIC ## Generative AI Evaluation and Governance
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This course introduces learners to evaluating and governing generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems. First, learners will explore the meaning behind and motivation of building evaluation and governance/security systems. Next, learners will be introduced to a variety of evaluation techniques for LLMs and their tasks. Next, the course will discuss how to govern and secure AI systems using Databricks. And finally, the course will conclude with an analysis of evaluating entire AI systems with respect to performance and cost.
