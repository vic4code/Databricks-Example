# MAGIC ## Machine Learning Operations
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This course will guide participants through a comprehensive exploration of machine learning model operations, focusing on MLOps and model lifecycle management. The initial segment covers essential MLOps components and best practices, providing participants with a strong foundation for effectively operationalizing machine learning models. In the latter part of the course, we will delve into the basics of the model lifecycle, demonstrating how to navigate it seamlessly using the Model Registry in conjunction with the Unity Catalog for efficient model management. By the course's conclusion, participants will have gained practical insights and a well-rounded understanding of MLOps principles, equipped with the skills needed to navigate the intricate landscape of machine learning model operations.
