# MAGIC ## Train / New Requests Split
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In a typical model training scenario, we would split the data into **training** and **test** sets to evaluate the model's performance. However, our focus here is on what happens once a model is trained and integrated into a production environment, where it encounters new data that was not part of its original training set.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To simulate this situation, we will split our existing dataset into a **training** set and a **new requests** set. This separation allows us to explore how the model handles incoming data that might differ from its training data, which can help us identify potential issues such as drift.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In order to simulate a drift in the model features, we will use the `Age` feature of our data to divide the sets. This approach enables us to study how the model's predictions change when exposed to data with characteristics that differ from the original training data.

# COMMAND ----------

# Split the data into training and request sets based on the 'Age' feature
train_df = diabetes_df_pd[diabetes_df_pd['Age'] <= 9]
request_df = diabetes_df_pd[diabetes_df_pd['Age'] > 9]

# Define the target column
target_col = "Diabetes_binary"

# Prepare training features and labels
X_train = train_df.drop(labels=[target_col, 'id'], axis=1)
y_train = train_df[target_col]

# Prepare request features and labels
X_request = request_df.drop(labels=[target_col], axis=1)
y_request = request_df[target_col]

# Set the MLflow registry URI to Unity Catalog
mlflow.set_registry_uri("databricks-uc")

# Enable automatic logging with MLflow
mlflow.sklearn.autolog(log_input_examples=True)

# Initialize and train the Decision Tree Classifier
dtc = DecisionTreeClassifier()
dtc_mdl = dtc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Define the model name using catalog and schema
model_name = f"{DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.diabetes_model"

# Infer the model signature

# MAGIC ## Save the Training Data as Reference for Drift
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We can save the training dataset that was used to train the model. This can be used later during monitoring to provide a reference to determine if a drift has happened between training and the new incoming requests.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Processing Inference Table Data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, we focus on extracting and analyzing data logged in the **inference table**. This table contains detailed information on each request and response received by the model. However, the raw format of this data is optimized for storage rather than immediate analysis. To effectively monitor and interpret the data, we will convert it into a more analyzable format using a series of steps.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps to Process Inference Table Data:**
# MAGIC 1. **Timestamp Conversion**: Convert the timestamp data from milliseconds to a human-readable timestamp format. This adjustment helps in analyzing the data based on when events occurred.
# MAGIC 2. **Unpacking JSON**: Requests and responses in the inference table are stored in JSON format. We'll unpack these JSON strings into a structured DataFrame format, making it easier to work with the data for analysis.
# MAGIC 3. **Exploding Batched Requests**: If the model receives batched requests, these will be exploded into individual records for simplified analysis. Each entry in a batch request is treated as a separate data point to ensure accuracy.
# MAGIC 4. **Schema Transformation**: We will transform the schema of the extracted data to better align it with analytical needs, facilitating easier data interpretation and monitoring.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC These steps will ensure that the inference data is optimized for analysis and monitoring, providing clear insights into how the model is performing over time.
# MAGIC

# MAGIC
# MAGIC **üìùNote for Instructors:**
# MAGIC The **inference table** used in this demo contains simulated or pre-populated data that mimics the behavior of a live inference table receiving real-time requests. This allows students to focus on analyzing and processing the data without needing to deploy a model during the exercise. It is important to guide students on how to handle live inference data in a real-world scenario where new requests are logged continuously.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Please note that**: Typically, we need to wait for the inference table to populate with new data, which usually takes about 5-7 minutes after batch predictions are triggered.

# MAGIC ## Analyzing Processed Requests
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After processing and unpacking the logged data from the inference table, the next step is to analyze the successfully answered requests by the model. This involves filtering the data to focus on successful interactions, merging with additional information, and thoroughly examining the model‚Äôs performance.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps for Analyzing Processed Requests:**
# MAGIC 1. **Filtering Requests**: Initially, we filter out the requests to only include those with a successful status code (200). This ensures that we are analyzing only the requests where the model was able to generate predictions.
# MAGIC 2. **Displaying Logs**: The filtered logs are then displayed, providing a clear view of the processed requests and their outcomes.
# MAGIC 3. **Merging Data**: We also merge these logs with additional label data that categorizes the results. This step is crucial for evaluating the model's performance against known outcomes.
# MAGIC 4. **Final Display**: The merged DataFrame is displayed, showing the complete information of the requests along with their corresponding labels. This provides a full picture of how the model is performing in real-world scenarios.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This detailed view helps in understanding the effectiveness of the model and in making necessary adjustments based on real-world data feedback.

# MAGIC ## Persisting Processed Model Logs
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After analyzing the model's responses and merging them with relevant labels, the final step involves saving these enriched logs for long-term monitoring and analysis. This step is critical for maintaining a historical record of model performance and enabling further analytical studies.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Steps for Saving Model Logs:
# MAGIC 1. **Preparing the Data**: The processed and labeled model logs are prepared for storage. At this point, the data includes all necessary details, such as predictions, request metadata, and corresponding labels.
# MAGIC 2. **Setting the Storage Mode**: We use the `append` mode when saving the DataFrame. This approach ensures that new entries are added to the existing dataset without overwriting previous logs, thereby accumulating a comprehensive log over time.
# MAGIC 3. **Saving the DataFrame**: The logs are saved as a table in the Databricks catalog under the specified catalog name and schema. Organizing data in this structured manner facilitates efficient management and easy retrieval for future analysis and monitoring.
# MAGIC 4. **Confirming Save Operation**: Finally, the operation concludes with the confirmation that the logs have been successfully appended to the designated table, indicating successful data persistence.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By systematically saving these logs, we establish a robust foundation for ongoing monitoring of the model's performance. This enables proactive management, detailed analysis, and continuous optimization of machine learning operations.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC - For every column in the primary table, the profile table shows summary statistics for the baseline table and for the primary table. The column `log_type` shows `INPUT` to indicate statistics for the primary table, and `BASELINE` to indicate statistics for the baseline table. The column from the primary table is identified in the column `column_name`.
# MAGIC - For `TimeSeries` type analysis, the `granularity` column shows the granularity corresponding to the row. For baseline table statistics, the `granularity` column shows `null`.
# MAGIC - The table shows statistics for each value of each slice key in each time window, and for the table as whole. Statistics for the table as a whole are indicated by `slice_key` = `slice_value` = `null`.
# MAGIC - In the primary table, the `window` column shows the time window corresponding to that row. For baseline table statistics, the `window` column shows `null`.  
# MAGIC - Some statistics are calculated based on the table as a whole, not on a single column. In the column `column_name`, these statistics are identified by `:table`.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC - For every column in the primary table, the drift table shows a set of metrics that compare the current values in the table to the values at the time of the previous analysis run and to the baseline table. The column `drift_type` shows `BASELINE` to indicate drift relative to the baseline table, and `CONSECUTIVE` to indicate drift relative to a previous time window. As in the profile table, the column from the primary table is identified in the column `column_name`.
# MAGIC   - At this point, because this is the first run of this monitor, there is no previous window to compare to. So there are no rows where `drift_type` is `CONSECUTIVE`. 
# MAGIC - For `TimeSeries` type analysis, the `granularity` column shows the granularity corresponding to that row.
# MAGIC - The table shows statistics for each value of each slice key in each time window, and for the table as whole. Statistics for the table as a whole are indicated by `slice_key` = `slice_value` = `null`.
# MAGIC - The `window` column shows the the time window corresponding to that row. The `window_cmp` column shows the comparison window. If the comparison is to the baseline table, `window_cmp` is `null`.  
# MAGIC - Some statistics are calculated based on the table as a whole, not on a single column. In the column `column_name`, these statistics are identified by `:table`.

The group defined by `slice_value=true` is considered the protected group ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-monitoring/fairness-bias.html)|[Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/lakehouse-monitoring/fairness-bias)).

# COMMAND ----------

fb_cols = ["window", "model_id", "slice_key", "slice_value", "predictive_parity", "predictive_equality", "equal_opportunity", "statistical_parity"]
fb_metrics_df = profile_df.select(fb_cols).filter(f"column_name = ':table' AND slice_value = 'true'")
display(fb_metrics_df.orderBy(F.rand()).limit(10))

# MAGIC ## Handling Drift Detection and Triggering Retraining `(Additional)`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Handle drift detection by analyzing the drift metrics, and trigger retraining and redeployment if drift is detected.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Analyze Metrics:** Load and analyze the drift metrics table to detect any drift in data or model performance.
# MAGIC - **Trigger Retraining:** Retrain the model if drift is detected.
# MAGIC - **Trigger Redeployment:** Redeploy the model if retraining is triggered.

# MAGIC # Conclusion
# MAGIC In this demo, we successfully processed and analyzed model inference logs to set up a monitoring framework for tracking the model's performance. We utilized inference data to detect any anomalies or drift and explored how to use Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring to continuously track and alert on key model performance metrics. Additionally, we demonstrated how to handle drift detection and initiate retraining processes to maintain optimal model performance over time. This comprehensive approach ensures that machine learning models remain reliable and effective, allowing for proactive management and continuous improvement.
