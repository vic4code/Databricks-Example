# MAGIC Databricks has support for MLflow with Unity Catalog (UC) integration and workspace based classic version. Although we won't go into the details of MLflow with UC in this demo, we will enable it. This means **models will be registered to UC**.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %pip install --upgrade 'mlflow-skinny[databricks]'
# MAGIC dbutils.library.restartPython()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Classroom Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before starting the demo, run the provided classroom setup script. This script will define configuration variables necessary for the demo. Execute the following cell:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup-1.2

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **Other Conventions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Throughout this demo, we'll refer to the object `DA`. This object, provided by Databricks Academy, contains variables such as your username, catalog name, schema name, working directory, and dataset locations. Run the code block below to view these details:

# COMMAND ----------

print(f"Username:          {DA.username}")
print(f"Catalog Name:      {DA.catalog_name}")
print(f"Schema Name:       {DA.schema_name}")
print(f"Working Directory: {DA.paths.working_dir}")
print(f"User DB Location:  {DA.paths.datasets}")

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Prepare Dataset
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Load Dataset
# MAGIC In this section, we will leverage the Feature Store to load the dataset for our machine learning experiment. Instead of directly reading from a CSV file, we will use the Feature Store setup to create a feature table and then read the data from it. This approach enhances reproducibility and ensures consistency in the datasets used for training and testing.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

import mlflow
feature_dataset = mlflow.data.load_delta(
    table_name = f"{DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.diabetes_binary", 
    name = "diabetes_binary"
)   
feature_data_pd = feature_dataset.df.toPandas()
# Drop the 'unique_id' column
feature_data_pd = feature_data_pd.drop("unique_id", axis=1)

# COMMAND ----------

display(feature_data_pd)

# COMMAND ----------

import pandas as pd

# Convert all columns in the DataFrame to the 'double' data type
for column in feature_data_pd.columns:
    feature_data_pd[column] = feature_data_pd[column].astype("double")

# If you want to see the updated types
print(feature_data_pd.dtypes)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Train / Test Split
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before proceeding with model training, it's essential to split the dataset into training and testing sets. This step ensures that the model is trained on one subset of the data and evaluated on an independent subset, providing a reliable estimate of its performance on new, unseen data.

# COMMAND ----------

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

print(f"We have {feature_data_pd.shape[0]} records in our source dataset")

# split target variable into it's own dataset
target_col = "Diabetes_binary"
X_all = feature_data_pd.drop(labels=target_col, axis=1)
y_all = feature_data_pd[target_col]

# test / train split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_all, y_all, train_size=0.95, random_state=42)
print(f"We have {X_train.shape[0]} records in our training dataset")
print(f"We have {X_test.shape[0]} records in our test dataset")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Fit and Log the Model
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that we have our training and testing sets, let's fit a Decision Tree model to the training data. During this process, we will use MLflow to log various aspects of the model, including parameters, metrics, and the resulting model itself.

# COMMAND ----------

dtc_params = {
  'criterion': 'gini',
  'max_depth': 50,
  'min_samples_split': 20,
  'min_samples_leaf': 5
}

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC In this code, we use MLflow to start a run and log parameters such as the criterion and max_depth of the Decision Tree model. After fitting the model on the training data, we evaluate its performance on the test set and log the accuracy as a metric.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **🚨 Important:** MLflow autologging is **enabled by default on Databricks**. This means you don't need to do anything for supported libraries. In the next section, we are disabling it and manually log params, metrics etc. just demonstrate how to do it manually when you need to log any custom model info.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **💡 Note: We won't define the `experiment name`, all *runs* generated in this notebook will be logged under the notebook title.**

# MAGIC #### Log Confusion Matrix
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The confusion matrix is a useful tool to visualize the classification performance of the model. It provides insights into the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's create the confusion matrix and **log it with MLflow** using **`log_figure`** function.

# COMMAND ----------

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay

# Computing the confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred, labels=[1, 0])

# Creating a figure object and axes for the confusion matrix
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

# Plotting the confusion matrix using the created axes
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=[1, 0])
disp.plot(cmap=plt.cm.Blues, ax=ax)

# Setting the title of the plot
ax.set_title('Confusion Matrix')

# Now 'fig' can be used with MLFlow's log_figure function
client.log_figure(run.info.run_id, figure=fig, artifact_file="confusion_matrix.png")

# Showing the plot here for demonstration
plt.show()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Log Feature Importance
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now, **let's examine and log the resulting model**. We'll extract and plot the feature importances inferred from the Decision Tree model to understand which data features are most critical for successful prediction.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Similar to the previous figure, we will use **`log_figure`** function.

# COMMAND ----------

import numpy as np

# Retrieving feature importances
feature_importances = dtc_mdl.feature_importances_
feature_names = X_train.columns.to_list()

# Plotting the feature importances
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
y_pos = np.arange(len(feature_names))
ax.bar(y_pos, feature_importances, align='center', alpha=0.7)
ax.set_xticks(y_pos)
ax.set_xticklabels(feature_names, rotation=45)
ax.set_ylabel('Importance')

# MAGIC #### Log Tree Structure
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Decision trees make splitting decisions on different features at different critical values, and visualizing the tree structure helps us understand the decision logic. We'll plot the branching tree structure for better interpretation.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We can get the tree in text format or as a graph. **To log the text format we will use `log_artifact` function.**

# COMMAND ----------

print(f"The fitted DecisionTreeClassifier model has {dtc_mdl.tree_.node_count} nodes and is up to {dtc_mdl.tree_.max_depth} levels deep.")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC This is a very large decision tree, printing out the full tree logic, we can see it is vast and sprawling:

# COMMAND ----------

from sklearn.tree import export_text

text_representation = export_text(dtc_mdl, feature_names=feature_names)
print(text_representation)

# save this to a local file
tree_struct_filename = "tree_structure.txt"
with open(tree_struct_filename,'w') as f:
  f.write(text_representation)

# log it to mlflow
client.log_artifact(run.info.run_id, tree_struct_filename)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Let's create a visually better looking version of this tree and log it with MLflow.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This demo guided us through the process of building, evaluating, and interpreting a Decision Tree model for classification tasks. We started by preparing and splitting the dataset, then proceeded to train the model using a Feature Store table. We manually logged key parameters, metrics, and artifacts using MLflow tracking, facilitating comprehensive experiment tracking and reproducibility. We examined and logged the model's performance through a confusion matrix, analyzed feature importances, and visualized the resulting tree structure. By leveraging MLflow, we demonstrated effective model tracking and experimentation management, contributing to a more informed and accountable machine learning workflow.
