# MAGIC # Hyperparameter Tuning with Hyperopt
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this hands-on demo, you will learn how to leverage **Hyperopt**, a powerful optimization library, for efficient model tuning. We'll guide you through the process of performing **Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, demonstrating how to define the search space, objective function, and algorithm selection**. Throughout the demo, you will utilize *MLflow* to seamlessly track the model tuning process, capturing essential information such as hyperparameters, metrics, and intermediate results. By the end of the session, you will not only grasp the principles of hyperparameter optimization but also be proficient in finding the best-tuned model using various methods such as the **MLflow API** and **MLflow UI**.

# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC 1. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC   - In the drop-down, select **More**.
# MAGIC   - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** pop-up, select the first drop-down. You will see a unique cluster name in that drop-down. Please select that cluster.
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC 1. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC 1. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.
# MAGIC 1. Once the cluster is running, complete the steps above to select your cluster.

# MAGIC ### Define the Hyperparameter Search Space
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Hyperopt uses a [Bayesian optimization algorithm](https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/#algorithms) to perform a more intelligent search of the hyperparameter space. Therefore, **the initial space definition is effectively a prior distribution over the hyperparameters**, which will be used as the starting point for the Bayesian optimization process. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Instead of defining a range or grid for each hyperparameter, we use [Hyperopt's parameter expressions](https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/getting-started/search_spaces/#parameter-expressions) to define such prior distributions over parameter values.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

from hyperopt import hp

dtc_param_space = {
  'criterion': hp.choice('dtree_criterion', ['gini', 'entropy']),
  'max_depth': hp.choice('dtree_max_depth',
                          [None, hp.uniformint('dtree_max_depth_int', 5, 50)]),
  'min_samples_split': hp.uniformint('dtree_min_samples_split', 2, 40),
  'min_samples_leaf': hp.uniformint('dtree_min_samples_leaf', 1, 20)
}

# MAGIC ### Define the Optimization Function
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We wrap our training code up as a function that we pass to hyperopt to optimize. The function takes a set of hyperparameter values as a `dict` and returns the validation loss score.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **💡 Note:** We are using `f1` score as the cross-validated loss metric. As we goal of optimization function is to minimize the loss, we are returning `-f1`, in other words, **we want to maximize the `f1` score**.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Run in Hyperopt
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After defining the *objective function*, we are ready to run this function with hyperopt. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As you may have noticed, tuning process will need to test many models. We are going to create an instance of **`SparkTrials()` to parallelize hyperparameter tuning trials using Spark**. This is useful for distributing the optimization process across a Spark cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `SparkTrials` takes a **`parallelism` parameter, which specifies how many trials are run in parallel**. This parameter will depend on the compute resources available for the cluster. You can read more about how to choose the optimal `parallelism` value in this [blog post](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/04/15/how-not-to-tune-your-model-with-hyperopt.html). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For search algorithm, we will choose the **TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) algorithm for optimization (`algo=tpe.suggest`)**.

# COMMAND ----------

from hyperopt import SparkTrials, fmin, tpe

# set the path for mlflow experiment
mlflow.set_experiment(f"/Users/{DA.username}/Demo-2.1-Hyperparameter-Tuning-with-Hyperopt")

trials = SparkTrials(parallelism=4)
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="Model Tuning with Hyperopt Demo") as parent_run:
  fmin(tuning_objective,
      space=dtc_param_space,
      algo=tpe.suggest,
      max_evals=5,  # Increase this when widening the hyperparameter search space.
      trials=trials)

best_result = trials.best_trial["result"]
best_run = best_result["run"]

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that we used a **nested run** while tracking the tuning process. This means we can access to the *parent_run* and child runs. One of the runs we would definitely be interested in is the *best_run*. Let's check out these runs.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

best_run.info

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Find the Best Run
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, we will search for registered models. There are couple ways for achieving this. We will show how to search runs using MLflow API, PySpark API and the UI.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Find the Best Run - MLFlow API
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using the MLFlow API, you can search runs in an experiment, which returns results into a Pandas DataFrame.

# COMMAND ----------

from mlflow.entities import ViewType

# search over all runs
hpo_runs_pd = mlflow.search_runs(
  experiment_ids=[parent_run.info.experiment_id],
  filter_string=f"tags.mlflow.parentRunId = '{parent_run.info.run_id}' AND attributes.status = 'FINISHED'",
  run_view_type=ViewType.ACTIVE_ONLY,
  order_by=["metrics.cv_f1 DESC"]
)

display(hpo_runs_pd)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Find the Best Run - PySpark API
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Alternatively, you can read experiment results into a PySpark DataFrame and use standard Spark expressions to search runs in an experiment.

# COMMAND ----------

import pyspark.sql.functions as sfn

all_experiment_runs_df = spark.read.format("mlflow-experiment")\
  .load(parent_run.info.experiment_id)

hpo_runs_df = all_experiment_runs_df.where(f"tags['mlflow.parentRunId'] = '{parent_run.info.run_id}' AND status = 'FINISHED'")\
  .withColumn("cv_f1", sfn.col("metrics").getItem('cv_f1'))\
  .orderBy(sfn.col("cv_f1").desc() )

display(hpo_runs_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Find the Best Run - MLflow UI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The simplest way of seeing the tuning result is to use MLflow UI. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Click on **Experiments** from left menu.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Select experiment which has the same name as this notebook's title (**2.1 - Hyperparameter Tuning with Hyperopt**).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * View the **parent run** and **nested child runs**. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * You can filter and order by metrics and other model metadata.
